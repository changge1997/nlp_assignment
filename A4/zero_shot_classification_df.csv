0,"First of all i'm not a big fan of buffet, i tried it because we got a $50 credit for staying here at Monte Carlo in Las Vegas and my friend wanted it so I gave it a chance. Decent taste and There wasn't enough variety of food, service wasn't that great either. so it still doesn't change my mind about buffet.",Hotels,Travel & Tourism,Restaurants,Restaurants
1,"Thanks Yelp. I was looking for the words to describe this place and Meh seems fitting.\n\nPlayboy club is located under Moon at the Palms. We got in for free thanks to the promoter hookup we got. First you can't take glassware from Moon down to Playboy. Security will take your glass and transfer the contents over to a plastic cocktail cup making you feel like you are a four year old when all of the big kids downstairs have real glassware.\n\nThere are a couple of tables here to gamble along with some video poker machines at the bar in the back of the club. The atmosphere here is relaxed and seems to cater to an older (40+) crowd. the bunnies here looked miserable, and complained about working. YOU ARE A PLAYBOY BUNNIE!! For the love of god TRY to be happy!\n\nI wouldn't come back here if I had to pay to get in, Playboy is rather small, though intimate. There is limited seating available here, and little to no dancing. Stick to here if you want to be able to hear your date and have a relaxing time. Go somewhere else if you are looking to party it up.",Entertainment,Restaurants,Restaurants,Bars

2,"Stamoolis Brothers is one of the Strip District storefronts, specializing in Greek and Mediterranean imports.  They have a good selection of olives, a decent cheese selection, a variety of ready-made dips and spreads which are pretty tasty, and some harder-to-find specialty items like rose water, pomegranate molasses, different grinds of bulgur wheat, bulk fava beans, etc.  You can also get packaged bulk nuts, dried fruits, etc.  When I go in here, it's usually because I'm looking for feta cheese or Greek-style yogurt.\n\nThis place is pretty good.  A couple times I've had some problems getting yogurt here, since they have a tendency to keep the yogurt on the shelf until it's almost at its sell-by date, but on the other hand, they have the cheapest price on Fage yogurt that I've seen in town thus far.  My mom loves a lot of their dips and spreads, so I get snacks from here a lot when she's in town.  The one caution I have (besides the yogurt) is that they sell an inferior brand of canned tomatoes here, which gives off a very strong flavor of metal and ruins your meal.",Entertainment,Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants
0,"I want to give a 2 stars because the service staff was friendly and good as well as ambience was decent.  But we came here for food not to meet the staff.  Food was just really mediocre, not even hot.  The hashbrowns taste pre-cut and frozen.  The \""real maple syrup\"" is just a maple syrup blend.  I could make a lot better food myself.  We had pancakes, bacon, and the wolf pack.  All the prices were way too high with food that's more on par with denny's.  Would rather IHOP across the street.   Unfortunately it looks like another lackluster joint resides here (before nypd pizza).",Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants
2,"I don't understand all the hype around this place. Yes it was on TV, but so what? \n\nEach time I go I am disappointed by something. For example, the salmon is typically undercooked and lacking seasoning. I love salmon so I tried it a few times hoping it would improve, but it didn't. Last time, instead of salmon I ordered a grilled wedge salad. It was covered in oil which made it inedible. \n\nThey also almost always mess something up in our take out order. Usually it is something small like giving us regular fries instead of garlic fries, but hey, we pay extra for the garlic! It is frustrating.  \n\nIn my opinion, the food at the Coffee Shop next door is much better.",Coffee Shops,Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants

1,"So I have been to Hickory Tavern many many times before. I am actually suprised I havent reviewed it until now. The view of the city is incredible and it is conveniently located in the Met, so we usually hit it before a Trader Joe's grocery shopping trip! \n\nUsually my husband and I get the Build Your Own Salads. 6 ingredients for $9. The oriental dressing is amazing and bacon and avocado on a salad is just A-mazing. In addition, I love that Hickory has Red Oak on tap. They have alot of local beers on draft and I love that about a restaurant.\n\nHowever, this review is more specifically directed to a situation we had today for lunch at HT. My husband and I decided to grab our typical BYO salads. I don't know what was going on but it took a long time to get our food. 25-30 minutes to get a salad is kinda crazy (I mean there wasnt even any cooked meat on it.....all raw ingredients!).Our waitress was super sweet though and came by saying that she had no idea why we hadn't gotten our food yet and that it should be there soon. We finally got our salads and dug in.....yummy dressing! However, about half way into the salad, my husband looks up and pulls out a piece of cardboard from his salad. It was about 2 inches by a half inch. Gross. We have both worked in the food industry and know that those boxes are dragged across the floor when being brought in. All I could picture is that nasty cardboard piece being spread across that whole (since the dressing was tossed into the salad). \n\nThe waitress was, once again, very sweet and didnt really know what to do and grabbed her manager. The manager came out and was talking about boxing up the salad to go. I am assuming she was talking about boxing up a new salad and not the one with the cardboard in it....I dont know. She also offered us a free brownie. Honestly, we didnt really want any other food at the time. They did comp his salad (which was very sweet, hence the 2 stars instead of 1) and charged me for mine. It was just kinda weird. I mean she did apologize but it just came across like it wasnt a big deal. \n\nKinda frustrating that we had this happen cause we LOVED going to Hickory Tavern in the past! I'm not sure if we will be back soon, simply cause I keep picturing that nasty piece of cardboard. Plus, there are so many other places to eat in the Met!",Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants
0,"On 28 June 2013 I checked into the Riviera Hotel and casino until 5 July 2013. After being placed in a downgraded room because my room wasn't available I got settled into room 3533. \nOn 30 June 2013 I went to turn on the floor lamp inside the room and I got a very powerful electric shock. My right hand and arm has very little feeling other than tingling now. I reported the incident immediately to the front desk. A security guard came up to my room and I filed an incident report. She assured me that Risk Management would call me. She took the lamp and told me maintenance would replace the lamp. The lamp wasn't replaced. After going to the ER I was diagnosed with Electric Shock Injury and was told feeling may never come back. I tried calling risk management every day. Finally after 2 days I went to the front desk and demanded to speak to someone regarding my injury. The manager, Debbie, came up and offered to refund my resort fees totaling $115.00 to make up for me losing the feeling in my arm by their faulty equipment in the room. They then upgraded me to the room I was supposed to have the whole time since I paid for an upgraded room. On 4 July 2013 housekeeping came to the room around 11 am. I told her I didn't need housekeeping and she said \""ok\"" and walked away. We left the room around 1:00 and returned around 2:30pm. Upon returning to the room none of the 4 keys we had worked. I went down to the front desk and they gave me 4 more keys. I went back to my room and those keys didn't work. I went back down but this time to the bell desk. I explained what happened and how I already got 4 new keys. He said he'd help and he followed me to my room. His key didn't work. He said something had to be wrong with the lock or mechanism so he left and went to engineering. 30 minutes later 2 security guards (1 male in a black suit and the female security who originally took my injury report) arrived at my room. They told me I was locked out of my room because housekeeping came in to clean and saw my BB gun I had in my room. He told me firearms aren't allowed in the building. I had kept my BB gun in my safe which I kept locked. I told the security how I had told housekeeping I didn't need service earlier. I also told him how my BB gun, which isn't a firearm because it does not use combustion to fire a projectile instead uses air, was locked in my safe and asked how the maid saw my gun and also why was she coming back after I told her I didn't want her in my room. He then told me I was to leave the premises and was banned or \""86'd\"". It took security an additional 30 minutes to get into my room because the door wasn't unlocking. The security guard kept trying to egg me on and asking \""Do you have a chip on your shoulder?\"" \""Are you mad?\"" \""Why are you mad?\"" He had to be asked to leave by the other security guards because he wouldn't stop egging me on. Once inside I saw my safe had been pried open, my BB gun was sitting on top of the safe and the do not disturb sign that was on the door was sitting next to the safe. All the money I had in the safe was taken. I requested to file a report and I was told Risk Management would call me Monday. They never called. They didn't refund me for my extra night stay. I filed a police report with Las Vegas Metro Police. I will never stay at the Riviera. I will never recommend anyone, not even my worst enemy to stay at the Riviera Hotel and Casino Las Vegas!!\n\nAttached is a video taken while security tried to fix the door the broke.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151779810399913&l=1311073713539322341",Travel & Tourism,Travel & Tourism,Unknown,Hotels

Be aware, they are super sweet and worth sharing. However I found myself finishing off mine and then eating my friends too. The warm, tart apples were perfection paired with the caramel drizzle and my nutella was melted perfectly inside the yummy crepe and strawberries. Complimentary water and or cucumber water is served to wash it all down but next time I'll definitely try the mimosas or one of the many sodas. \nThere is a great selection of dinner crepes too that I'm dying to try!",Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants

1,"First, I came here with a coupon from one of those entertainment books my daughter's school sells.  Many items were excluded including the lunch specials and the menudo.  Apparently, to be truly Mexican you have to enjoy eating a cow's stomach in soup -- menudo.  So Eli M. and I vowed to return one day.  Ah, yes, I am not even a little Mexican, but suffer from a proclivity to try unusual foods others turn up their noses at.  Enter Groupon.\n\nHaving purchased a Groupon that excluded the lunch specials, but not the menudo, Eli M. and I, with some friends in tow, made our return.  I told Eli M. that menudo costing less than $7 seemed a little dubious given the extensive perpetuation process he described, but we didn't let a little thing like that deter us. As the menudo was cheaply priced, I also ordered a chorizo burrito a la carte.  I was trying to max out the Groupon, and soup, regardless of the contents, didn't seem that filling.  Eli M. doesn't eat much and was satisfied with just a medium sized bowl of menudo. In terms of taste however, he said that it was okay.  He said it was too greasy, which is what our friends also said of their food.  Moreover, they have Pepsi instead of Coke.  And the location is a bit out off the quick lunch radius.  So, it looks like Eli M. and I will max out at two visits to Susie's.  Thanks for the menudo.",Entertainment,Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants
1,"The menu displayed on urban spoon must be very old. The prizes are higher, than we researched before. Staff is friendly. The soups must be based on an instant brew. I ordered a wantang soup and it was terrible. I could taste the chemical taste of the instant brew. It was very bland.  Knowing how good a lotus stem salad usually tastes, I ordered one. Again, I felt like I wasted 10$. The sauce was terribly bland, too sweet and too sour at the same time. Also, they used way too much celery. I was very disappointed and felt like I wasted my time and money. I felt this place was WAAAY to over-prized for what they offer. And I didn't feel that it tasted authentic or refreshing like Vietnamese food usually tastes.  The menu was just the same as in Lang Van. I did see Asian people in the restaurant. So, it must be somewhat decent. The food doesn't have a \""restaurant feel\"", but more an \""American-Asian fast food feel\"".They should restructure the portions and prizing.

They were very cooperative with replacing the patty and each our plates came with the most delicious chocolate chip cookie that was oh so very soft and moist.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and attentive.

The vegetarian entrees at most Mexican restaurants can be dull, but not here.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the chile relleno, served with roasted vegetables and jicama salad, and the wild mushroom enchiladas served with borracho beans and rice.  The chile relleno was stuffed with a mixture of dried fruit, almonds, and cheese, and the contrast between sweet and savory was a party in my mouth.  The salad was light and the orange dressing was a refreshing surprise.  The enchiladas were drenched with a velvety poblano sauce, and combined with the mushrooms, the enchiladas just slid down my throat.  The borracho beans were a smoky kidney beans with a hint of chili powder.  Oh, and don't skip the chips and fire roasted salsa; it's so good that you'll want to drink it straight from the bowl.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Ancho Brownie, garnished with pepita ice cream.  This ancho infused brownie was ooey, gooey, and very fudgy. \n\nThe ambiance is nice for people watching, and the restaurant's location next to the canal gives the illusion that you are dining outside.

If I am the latter, then I would say that the toppings we tried on three different pizzas were all good but could have been more plentiful. We especially liked the artichoke and olive pizza. Whatever exotic cheeses the chefs put on the pizzas are terrific but are just dotted on. I left the restaurant last night feeling crusty, which is to say I love the wood-fired, slightly burned, soft-on-the-inside crust.

I placed an order online from the 1010 E Desert Inn Rd. location for the special that they had for 3 medium/ 3 topping pizza's thinking that I will do something special for my wife, since she didn't eat anything at work. This was my first time I ever ate Papa John's. Everything was great when ordering and the delivery driver calling to let me know that she is 10 minutes away. When she arrive at our hotel at 7:20PM, I gave her a tip and accepted the pizza's without ever looking at them. As soon as I sat down with my wife in our hotel room, we looked at the pizza's and it looked like the pizza's were cold (cheese getting firm as if it were sitting out long). I called the Papa John's location and spoke with the manager around 7:30PM. He had offered to get new ones sent. I called back at 7:42PM asking the manager if we should give the old pizza's back to the driver that is coming to drop of the new pizza's, he then said that we didn't need to. So my wife and I were so hungry and waited for the pizza's to arrive. We had the opportunity to stare at the cold pizza's and realized how skimpy the toppings were and one of the pizza's looked burnt on the bottom. One pizza for example, had anchovies, chicken and onions. We couldn't even see the chicken and onions, so it looked like an anchovy pizza. I had time to take nice pictures of them. I called the Papa John's location again around 8:32PM. I was so upset that we haven't received the pizza's yet. They said that the driver went to the wrong address and should be there shortly and that the pizza's were piping hot out of the oven. I doubt that they were piping hot, especially arriving late. At 8:44PM, the driver called me and said that he was outside the hotel. I told him to send the pizza's back because it was late already, one hour and 14 minutes later from the time that I called at 7:30PM to get the replacement pizza's. I filled out a feedback form online at the Papa John's website the same night. It is already 08/07/13 and I still haven't received a call from who ever it may concern.

I had a 12:40AM to ATL Monday morning.  Leaving Hohokam Park around 9PM (about 6-7 miles from SH), I didn't get to the f'n car rental center (a whole different story) until 10:30.  \n\nWho's genius idea was it to close the airport exit and re-direct traffic from a 4 lane to a one-lane bottleneck into the airport?  That could have been the dumbest, most inefficient thing I have seen since DC shut the interstate near RFK.  Traffic was unbelievable.  And I didn't realize it took another 15 minutes to get to the car rental \""center\"".\n\nAfter finally getting to the terminal, check in was slow, considering the amount of people they should have been expecting (they had red-eyes going to CHI, JFK, and ATL, amongst other places).  Getting to security was ridiculous- I would have rather gotten a handy from TSA then the circus they were running.  Apparently, waving my sunscreen in the air \""who's is this?\""  I should have told them it was my buttplug.   I told them, they said I could check it, but I couldn't let it go.  Cya, sunscreen.  \n\nAnother fascinating aspect was I had my cough syrup, hand sanitizer, and my lighter on me.  They could care less about the lighter.  The hand-gel - gone.  And my syrup, they made me take my stuff, and open it, they were testing it for God-only-knows. They didn't care about checking my ID to make sure the contents were mine though, just to make sure it wasn't on their list?  Is that not ass-backwards?\n\nFinally getting through, there wasn't shit open to eat or shop, a big no-no for people trying to get the hell home- I mean after taking 2 hours to go 6 miles that gets you hungry!\n\nThe actual airport itself was dated in some parts, but it was clean, its only saving grace.\n\nIMO, this place has a long ways to go to be a well oiled machine, which is a huge disappoinment being a gateway to the west.",Entertainment,Travel & Tourism,Travel & Tourism,Medical Services

1,"First let me start by saying I found Nathalie's by browsing groupon.Prior to purchasing the groupon I called to verify the detail and ensure it covered what I needed (grooming of a lab), I was told yes and set up an appt for the next day. Upon arrival I was told it does NOT cover the cut of a lab and I would incur an extra fee, I was slightly irritated since I had already spoken to someone prior to my purchase but I said ok and asked how much... The response was \""I didn't know you had a groupon, I'm not sure, I'll let you know\"" I didn't like it being left open ended but thought it couldn't be more than $10-20 and I would still be getting a good deal so it's fine and I left her. Let me also add here that prior to leaving and when filling out my paperwork I alerted them my lab is older and her hips are bad to please be careful. A few hours later we came back to pick her up, I was told I needed to pay $35 more for the cut and because they had to hold her up to shave her. That's literally double the cost of the groupon I purchased! Also, my lab is old but she can stand and I have NEVER had a problem or been charged extra for grooming her bc of her age. We were told the normal price for a groom of a lab was $65 (we would be paying $70) and to consider it as getting the spa package for free which was actually supposed to already have been a part of the groupon I had purchased. I asked to speak with the groomer bc I was not paying an extra $35... I agreed to pay extra for the cut but I refused to pay double, I was told she had no idea I had a groupon (not sure why that even matters, a groom is a groom regardless of the payment) no idea it was a lab, or that she was older. I clearly stated a lab when I made my appt, I also let Nathalie know about her hips when I signed her in. The groomer finally agreed and said I did not have to pay the extra $35 but I'm still in awe of the extra money they tried to get out of us. They should not run a groupon if you can't afford to take the loss on money to gain new clients, I felt scammed. I also have to add the job was not done well... After this \""spa package\"" and bath she came home with goop still in her eye, she had some kind of gross something on her tail, and there were several areas of long hair left that was uncut.

There is way too much and far too many pictures of the food for anyone to make a reasonable decision.  So I asked the guy \""what's good\"" to which he replied \""besides everything?\""  Oh har har - aren't you clever.  Now I'm pissed at you.  So after trying to drag an answer out of him, I told him I wanted spicy and he suggested boring Kung Pao Chicken.  I took his advice which, now, makes me more mad at him because it really wasn't good.  It was a giant plate of 10000 peanuts, 10 stalks of celery, and some giant mutant chicken.  Was there value for the meal? Sure.  Was it good enough to justify ever eating that much of it?  Absolutely not!  It was decently spicy but, more so, it was just hot.  Like - I stuck this in the microwave for 10 minutes kind of hot.  \n\nLet's just say, I won't be back here.  The staff was unhelpful and the food was insane.

Their system was down so they did everything manually, approved it and I was on my way. I returned the car three days later and their computers are STILL down. They receive the car and hand write me a bill saying the card that I gave them would be charged.\n\n The next day I look at my statements and the card I gave them has been charged. I look at my bank statement and they've also charged me a deposit for a rental on my debit card, the day after I returned the car! I called them to get it straightened out because i figure it's simple human error because of their systems being down and that they can just drop the charge on my visa. \n\n I call them and they insist that i'm mistaken and I must have given them a visa. They look at the imprint of the card and go figure; it's the AMEX I paid for the rental with. Too bad though, they charged my debit card for it and they claim they can't do anything about it now (even though it's still pending). They also have a charge on my AMEX, so I don't have access to those funds either. The thing is; I never presented them my visa and they don't have a swipe, imprint or record of it other than via Orbitz. \n\n The people at the counter both times were great, but the manager Albert was rude and seemed put out that I wanted him to look into this. He had someone else call me back, presumably because he didn't want to admit his mistake, and essentially tell me to call their billing department on Monday to have them charge the Amex for the final bill and they'll refund  the other card in 5-7 days.\n\nPS: the convertible I rented was beaten into the ground.

My husband ordered a prime rib for $37, which tasted average, and was literally a slab of meat on an otherwise empty plate.  The man who poured our water and delivered the bread to the table showed the only ounce of kindness out of anyone in the restaurant.  \n\nSince gratuity was included, we were forced to pay two individuals who treated us with absolute disrespect over $400 in gratuity.

2,"Everything you'd expect from a high end casino's buffet: Huge selection, decent quality foods, and overpriced admission.  I'm not saying that it was a bad experience; On the contrary, I enjoyed my visit.  But to me, in the end the food doesn't justify the price.  I'll elaborate.\n\nAs I mentioned, the food selection is quite extensive and diverse.  It seems every major nationality and ethnicity is represented somewhere in the buffet.  I'll use my gluttony as an example: My first plate consisted of asian-style stir fry and meats, with rice and an Asian soup.  My second plate was build-it-yourself tacos, with middle eastern style doughy stuff and meats.  My third plate was typical American, steak and trip-tip with potatoes and corn. The dessert section is fairly large too- lots of gelatos, cakes, and other sweet treats.  Overall, most of the food quality would range between very good to excellent.\n\nNow, even though the buffet is tasty and diverse, I still have a few negatives I can't quite get over:\nPrice- The buffet is great, but it's quality isn't much different from other buffets on the strip.  For example, the quality equals that of Planet Hollywood's buffet, and PH comes in at around $10 cheaper per person, with a shorter wait time. Which leads me to my next point...\nService- If you come during meal times, you're going to wait.  Unless you're a VIP, you wait to pay and wait again to be seated.  From the time we got in line until we got seated took about 40 minutes, which is kind of crazy for a lunch.  And after you're seated, if you're thirsty you are at the mercy of a server and must wait for beverages and refills. Which in our experience, was very lacking and slow. I went through two plates of food with an empty drink, and only received a refill when I flagged down a different passing server. \n\nSo in conclusion, the food was very good and the selection was great.  The price was steep and the service lackluster.  Next time I do a Vegas buffet, I'll probably try somewhere else where the cost is a bit more in line with the value.",Restaurants,Travel & Tourism,Travel & Tourism,Restaurants

The booths are so comfy, you may never want to leave and that could be very dangerous here! Unfortunately I am with the minority on this one after this visit. I wanted to make it here for brunch but that didn't happen so dinner it was. There wasn't too many other parties it was pretty empty in there when we arrived. Off season and no Sommelier this day. We sat inside first and ordered some Peroni (am I the only one who finds an Italian beer here a little weird?) to drink. Some tomato bread which the server promptly corrected me \""You mean Pan con Tomate?!? Yes I wont touch that one. Then the Tortilla Espanola I tried those at the OYE already and they were delicous I would probably come here just for those!\n\nNow we had forgotten there was happy hour and were told it was only on the patio or at the bar, we thought it was a tad odd considering the place was so empty. So we decided we'd like to move out on the patio mind you HH was almost over. So the waitress tells us that we would have to close out the bill then move outside where she would be our server again. Huh?? The hub asked what he thought was a manager if it would be a problem he was just a waiter and told us \""Yes that will be a problem\"" so after a lot of looking at each other like WTF our waitress finally gets the manager please forgive me I am so bad w names people. He came over and told us we didnt have to move if we wanted that we could order off the HH menu. Thank you! At that time we decided to move outside anyway for the view, they helped move all our stuff over after that dilemma everything went pretty smoothly.\n\nWe continued with the soft lettuce it was really good the almonds were awesome but I cant say anything special about the sauce unfortunately. Next came the calamari def worth trying its a good size portion and worth every penny. The shrimp I will probably pass on next time they were ok not worth 4 for $16 eh I did not think they were that special tasting but they were big. Then there was the piquillo pepper it was stuffed with tuna I was expecting raw tuna or something not canned, it wasn't spicy at all. Think tuna salad but there was capers instead of pickles it wasnt anything special go for something else or I'd suggest it for lunch more than anything. We did not have any dessert nothing really appealed to us on the menu so we just ordered another round of drinks the mojito I had for desert was ok as well.\n\nThis place reminds me of the Scottsdale stereo type where I was not blown away by the food and the normal overpriced drinks I can see this being a neutral watering hole where the cougar and trout come out of their lairs to play simultaneously during the cooler months. I did not see anyone dressed up so I am guessing thats more of a night thing. Overall this experience was 2 stars the ambiance and the drinks get one more. Super Strong drinks here and with the possibility that I ordered the wrong things this time I will be back to try more stuff and figure out what I like.

My advice to any guy going to a club in Vegas, you NEED a table, otherwise you will be standing at the bar looking like a complete ZERO getting poked with side yabs and percodan hardons from various blowjobs and douchebags. \n\nArriving at the Venetian, standing atop the grand staircase outside the hallowed gateway into Tao, my buddy spent the first ten minutes on the phone w/our connection inside.

I have been already living in my new condo almost a month and I'm still waiting for things to be fixed. Heather has been rude to me most of the times I have called her to check the status on my work orders that have been taking forever and it seems like I am always irrupting her and bothering when I call her. The HOA office for Blackhorse condos is a joke as well, another rude company. After this I don't think I'll re-new my lease here.",Real Estate,Real Estate,Real Estate,Real Estate

2,"Apparently, this place is only hot when a game is on.  I came here on a Saturday night around 10:30pm and there were only 5 other patrons.  The place is huge, so it looked even more pathetic than it sounds.  \n\nI got the Kilt Lifter Scottish Ale, a locally brewed amber beer that was quite flavorful and not too bitter.  They have a good selection of beers on tap including imports and domestic.  I had already eaten dinner, so I didn't attempt to indulge in the Big Unit, but checked out the menu just for yuks.  Quite a variety of options and most meals seem to be named after a certain person.  Cute touch.  But no assignment of credit for who inspired the big unit...\n\nAll the staff here have black teardrops ala Alice Cooper.  Lots of guitars on the walls and three HUGE TV screens above the bar.  Outdoor seating and music blasting in and outside.\n\nThanks to Jim B. for the recommendation to come here.  It gave me conversation fodder :)",Entertainment,Restaurants,Restaurants,Bars

Let's just say that there is a reason the cliche exists of the old, fat, balding assholes with ponytails.  The group that trolls the sales counter are a bunch of scumbags.  Went in to buy something that they were selling for a total of $107.00, and they told me that if I waited a week they were having a giant sale and I could get it as an even better deal.  So I rolled the dice and took the chance.  Low and behold, it was still there, I was very happy, but when I went to pay, the item had suddenly risen in price by almost $75.00.  You could still see the level of dust that was there from how long it was sitting on the shelf.  You could also see the sticker over the old one.  When I called them on their shit, they didn't know whether to shit or wind their watch.  A bunch of deceitful assholes.  I'm willing to bet that it's still sitting there.  The rest of the place and employees were nice enough, but the toys stooges were a bunch of basement dwelling fuck tards.",Home Services,Restaurants,Unknown,Education
1,"I thought I liked this place, but after yesterday, I can say the food is mediocre. The cafe itself looks really nice and would lead you to believe it is expensive so of course the food had to be good....not today, might have just been the afternoon chefs at the time or something they normally do to all their food, but they use a lot of oil when they cook.\nI ordered the seared trout, and that thing was smothered with oil under, I had to keep drinking water, even the green beans that were on top were really oily. One of my friends had orderd some hash browns, although they came out extra crispy the way they like it, it was also drenched in oil.

1,"This was our first time to this location of Del Frisco's.  The restaurant was empty (and its SAT night...hmm....) other than one table for two in which they seat us right next to that table......and by the back area where all of the servers hang out and talk LOUDLY.  The service was not great as the only other table that came in was a large party of 12 which they shifted tables and put them right next to us.  So, our server completely abandons us and goes to help them. (Why not one of the other 20 servers standing there talking?????)  I had to finally flag down someone to get our check!  Food was ok, nothing spectacular, just OK.  Too many other fabulous steak and seafood places to go to for the same price point such as Mastro's which I highly recommend.  MUCH better ambience and top notch service there at Mastros! Del Frisco is an outdated, stuffy feeling place and for what ever reason, it smells like the sewer in there but it may be just the old carpet.  DEFINITELY needs updating.

Upon entering this bistro, which is nestled on a beautiful street between many restaurants and clothing and furniture boutiques, we were instantly immersed in quintessential french aromas.

Delicious\n\nVegetable soup a tomato based soup with beef broth and lots of veggies, like quash, corn. Yum\n\nEntrees:\n\nCroque Monseiur fried buttery cheesy toast with ham. Delicious.\n\nBeef stuffed Ravioli. Over the top Delicious, I used my bread to sop up all the broth from my plate because it was so delicious and flavorful.\n\nAlso the restaurant has had the same menu for 30 years most of their dishes have been perfected, so don't offend and ask for substitutions. Everything looks and probably tastes delicious. People sitting next to us ordered egg salad, salmon, stewed mushrooms and liver over fries, steak and every dish looked scrumptious.",Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants,Restaurants
3,"I fly - a lot - and I have to say that Sky Harbor is one of the better airports in the country. It's one of the highest volume airports yet it's reasonably well organized. I've heard that about 75% of the air traffic flows through Terminal 4 (that's where US Air and SouthWest fly out of). \n\nIf you've going to fly out of Phoenix very often my advice would be to start using US Air or SouthWest because a) it's a hub for both of them and b) you'll have much better flight choices and c) because of the competition, the prices tend to be better. The other terminals, by comparison, are nearly deserted. Terminals 2 and 3 have very limited food choices. Terminal 4 has improved a lot in that regard. \n\nThere is a lot of parking available, both on site and off site. The off site parking, naturally, is cheaper but you have to wait for the buses to bring you to the terminal. Compared to other airports of comparable size the on site parking is not that expensive. If it's a business trip and you are getting reimbursed for the parking, just park on site and save yourself the hassle. Honestly, the best way to get in and out of Sky Harbor is not to drive at all but to use a transportation service. I'm not talking about Stupper-Shuttle - don't get me started on them - but a real sedan service that will drop you at the curb and meet you at the security gate when you arrive back home. \n\nIf you can, print your boarding pass at home rather than waiting in line at the airport. The airline clubs, in my view, are a waste of money. As another reviewer pointed out, the wi-fi access is now free at Sky Harbor. I used to belong to the US Air club but let it lapse. The snacks are not that good, they were charging for drinks. Unless you are regularly connecting through Phoenix how much time are you really going to spend in the airport? Now if you're connecting and have a long layover then it might be worthwhile but otherwise I'd skip it. \n\nI got a laptop stolen here once so a word about security. If you have a laptop computer, put it through the x-ray machine last and don't take your eye off it for a moment. Particularly if it's very busy.",Home Services,Travel & Tourism,Travel & Tourism,Home Services
0,"This is my last update. I am not satisfied at all. After playing telephone tag for two days, with a package delivery pending the next day, I physically went to the site and spoke with Adrian Maldonado. He backed his driver completely, but told me that the immediate supervisor would be with him when he delivered my package and that the driver would personally apologize to me.\n\nThe driver, who I now know is named Clark, didn't say a word until I asked him to apologize. I was told what a good driver he was for the past 15 years and that he would not be parking in handicapped spaces anymore and I had nothing to worry about in the future because he would do a good job. I had his bosses guarantee. When in response to the supervisor asking me if I was satisfied, I said, \""No, it was my understanding that Clark would be apologizing personally,\"" the supervisor tried to tell me that because he was the boss, I could be assured that Clark wouldn't do these things anymore. I again reiterated that this is not what I was told would happen. I then turned to Clark and explained to him directly why what he did was not cool.\n\nHis non apology was \""I'm sorry you feel that way.\"" \n\nSo some effort made, but not really changing my mind about how horrible this company is run locally. Still think Clark is an asshole who thinks this is all a joke. Why should he change. It is obvious his supervisors don't want to make him change and want to defend him. \n\nHowever, we are stuck with them for the moment because we have several items pending, but once our current situation changes, future efforts will be made to avoid UPS as much as possible. \n\nSupposedly competition was supposed to be good for the market, but now two companies dominate the delivery industry.

1,"I think im done with Ghost Bar. This use to be my chill spot to take out of town visitors to impress them with the view, atmosphere and the mild party vibe. This last Friday i made list arrangements with a NEW promoter with the N9NE Group which i think is what F'ed me. My regular girl has been MIA for a while and so i needed to act fast and find somebody so i settled for this. Just myself with 3 girls on the list should not have been a problem. Had to do something new this time and check in at LA Tan in the palms (that was weird #1) as i never did this and was given a ticket that looked like i was going to see Shrek at the movies. Did the usual and got to the rope to find the Clipboard Master to drop a name and was told that these dumb ass tickets i got from La Tan still made me wait in line (weird #2) as why make previous arrangements to stand in line? So since im anti Disneyland lines i gave security a $50 shake and got passed that hurdle. Then when i got to the register... guess what i had to pay $25 to get in (weird #3). Im sorry but this has never happened in the past when dealing with the promoters ahead of time and making sure i kept their guy girl ratios in mind and favorable toward the girls obviously. So $75 bucks later im in Ghost Bar...and a little annoyed. \nFirst round of drinks i worked toward the outside bar to the left only to find out that they dont have Seagram's 7 for my 7&7... say WUT! Really? Your gonna charge me $15 for a drink and you cant even carry the basic essentials behind your bar... fine ill take a Maker's Mark and coke which was made horribly as i like to enjoy my drinks and this was WAY too strong. The second round was bought at the main bar where they had everything and made alright but the wait was retarded, as it would be way more efficient if they stocked the outdoor bars properly. \nBeside the negatives Ghost Bar still obviously remains to be a great view of the city with a decent DJ at times and an overall decent feel. But could be improved upon quite a bit to make the place worth spending the $15/ drink prices a more enjoyable experience. This was my last run to Ghost Bar since the issues at the door were slightly embarrassing and honestly ridiculous, i dont know if i have N9NE Group to thank for that or the actual bar/club but either way ill spend my money elsewhere where the service is more appreciative. I think Ghost Bar needs to take a step back and improve upon a few things but doubtful that will happen.",Travel & Tourism,Bars,Bars,Bars
